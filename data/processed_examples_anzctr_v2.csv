2,"ACTRN12615000345583",46,"a sample size of 114 participants will be required to determine a 7 percent equivalence rate on the koos with a 11 percent sd assuming 90 percent power and 95 percent confidence interval. a 10 percent drop-out rate has been included within this sample size."
3,"ACTRN12618001067268",128,"shapiro-wilk test was used as normality test. continuous variables were compared using student t-test and mann-whitney u-test when the data were not normally distributed. categorical variables were compared using pearson s chi-squared test and fisher s exact test. paired data were analysed using paired t-test and wilcoxon signed-rank test when data were not normally distributed. for responses at different time points percent changes were calculated according to baseline measurement. these percent changes were compared using mann-whitney u-test for two groups and kruskal-wallis test more than two groups. correlations between variables were tested using pearson and spearman correlation coefficients. a p-value less-than 0.05 was considered as significant. all statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss ver. 23.0."
