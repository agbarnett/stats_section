10.1371/journal.pone.0049486,Data Analysis,"for behavioral analysis, a correct trial was defined as a correct button press occurring between 100 and 3000 ms from target onset. mean rt relative to target-onset was computed for correct trials only. rt and hit rate were analyzed using repeated measures 2×3 anovas with two within-subject factors: cue type (informative, non-informative) and task condition (cue repeat, cue switch, task switch).our choice of analysis windows and channels was done according to former task-switching studies (cf., [4], [19], [21], [25], [37]), and in agreement with a visual inspection of mean erp data. mean amplitudes were extracted for the cue-locked p2 in the window of 180–220 ms at f1, fz, f2, fc1, fcz, fc2 as in west et al., 2011 [23]. a similar analysis windows for mean p2 amplitudes were used in previous studies [19], [25], [37]. mean cue-locked p3 amplitudes (450–550 ms; cp1, cpz, cp2, p1, pz, p2) were measured within the same time window as jamadar and colleagues (2010; also cf., [19], [25]). target-locked n2 peak amplitude and latency were measured at c1, cz and c2 sites in the time window 200–500 ms, following former literature which researched modulations in the n2 regarding cognitive control [29], [37]–[39]. target-locked n2 analyses were performed at mid-central sites, consistent with previous studies which described the central n2 peaking at cz [40], and with the scalp topographies of target-locked peak n2 amplitudes for both informatively cued trials and non-informatively cued trials. one study that guided our choice of this rather wide window for peak n2 latency is by leleu and colleagues (2010) [31]. these authors analyzed the n2 component within a 400 ms time window (200–600 ms) and found task related effects from 200–450 ms post-target.for the analysis of target-locked erps, a full factorial design was used including cue type (informative, non-informative) and task condition (cue-repeat, cue-switch, and task-switch) and laterality (left, central, right).in order to examine whether a pure sensory change in cue modulates performance and brain activity, we compared cue repeat trials with cue switch trials for both, informative and non-informative trials using repeated anovas with a 2 (cue type) × 2 (task condition) × 2 (frontality) × 3 (laterality) design. due to the null result of this analysis, a random selection of trials assured similar numbers of switch and repeat trials across both non-informatively and informatively cued trials. moreover, data was subsequently subjected to a second repeated measures anova with factors: 3 (trial type: non-informative cued trials, informative task repeat, informative task switch) × 2 (frontality) × 3 (laterality). channel lines f and cp served as frontality level 1 and lines fc and p as factor level 2, respectively for the analysis of the p2 and p3. the three levels for laterality are associated with the left, central and right channels. all post-hoc tests for behavioral and erp analyses were performed with t-tests and a bonferroni correction was used to adjust p-values for all multiple pairwise contrasts. greenhouse-geisser corrections were used to adjust degrees of freedom whenever the assumption of sphericity was violated.", behavioural analysis correct trial defined correct button press occurring between 100 3000 ms target onset. mean rt relative target-onset computed correct trials . rt hit rate analysed repeated measures 23 anova two within-subject factors cue type informative non-informative task condition cue repeat cue switch task switch. choice analysis windows channels done according former task-switching studies cf. agreement visual inspection mean erp data. mean amplitudes extracted cue-locked p2 window 180-220 ms f1 fz f2 fc1 fcz fc2 west et al. 2011 . similar analysis windows mean p2 amplitudes previous studies . mean cue-locked p3 amplitudes 450-550 ms cp1 cpz cp2 p1 pz p2 measured within time window jamadar colleagues 2010 also cf. . target-locked n2 peak amplitude latency measured c1 cz c2 sites time window 200-500 ms following former literature researched modulations n2 regarding cognitive control -. target-locked n2 analyses performed mid-central sites consistent previous studies described central n2 peaking cz scalp topographies target-locked peak n2 amplitudes informatively cued trials non-informatively cued trials. one study guided choice rather wide window peak n2 latency leleu colleagues 2010 . authors analysed n2 component within 400 ms time window 200-600 ms found task related effects 200-450 ms post-target. analysis target-locked erps full factorial design including cue type informative non-informative task condition cue-repeat cue-switch task-switch laterality left central right. order examine whether pure sensory change cue modulates performance brain activity compared cue repeat trials cue switch trials informative non-informative trials repeated anova 2 cue type-II task condition 2 frontality 3 laterality design. due null result analysis random selection trials assured similar numbers switch repeat trials across non-informatively informatively cued trials. moreover data subsequently subjected second repeated measures anova factors 3 trial type non-informative cued trials informative task repeat informative task switch 2 frontality 3 laterality. channel lines f cp served frontality level 1 lines fc p factor level 2 respectively analysis p2 p3. three levels laterality associated left central right channels. post-hoc tests behavioural erp analyses performed t-test bonferroni correction adjust p-value multiple pairwise contrasts. greenhouse-geisser corrections adjust degrees freedom whenever assumption sphericity violated.

10.1371/journal.pone.0084825,DTI data analysis,"the dti data processing and analytic methods have been described in detail elsewhere [14], [17]. dti data was preprocessed and analyzed using the oxford centre for functional mri of the brain (fmrib) diffusion toolbox from the fmrib software library release 4.1.3 (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). briefly, the raw dti data for each participant were first corrected for head movement and eddy current distortions. a binary brain mask was generated using the baseline non-diffusion weighted (b<U+200A>=<U+200A>0) image. diffusion tensor models were then fitted independently for each voxel within the brain mask and fractional anisotropy was calculated for all brain voxels. next, probabilistic tractography was performed in native space for each participant. probabilistic tractography was used to parcellate the tracts of interest, a method that has been described elsewhere [14]. briefly, this method is based on probability distributions that guide multiple fiber samples starting from a seed voxel to a specified target region. also, this method models multiple fiber orientations passing through the same voxel and has been shown to be robust to resolving crossing fibers which is critical for tractography in the brainstem [18]. tractography was performed using the brainstem mask as the seed and the striatum (nigrostriatal tract), amygdala (solitary tract) and precentral cortex (corticospinal tract) as the target regions. for the brainstem, a single axial slice approximately at the end of the midbrain and before the pons was used to outline the brainstem and used as seed mask for each individual participant (refer to supplementary figure s1). for the target regions, the regions were identified using the freesurfer analysis of the participant’s structural t1 weighted mri data and were used as masks (described in detail in [14]). one thousand fiber streamlines were generated from each voxel within the seed region, and only those that reached the target region were retained as the final white matter connection. the streamlines were terminated once they reached a target region. only those voxels with at least 40% of the maximum streamlines passing through them were retained as part of the final white matter tract. tractography for the three tracts of interest (left and right separately) were performed and quality checked visually by three authors for all participants (figure 1). the mean fa value for each tract was then calculated.", dti data processing analytic methods described detail elsewhere . dti data preprocessed analysed oxford centre functional mri brain fmrib diffusion toolbox fmrib software library release 4.1.3 httpwww.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl. briefly raw dti data participant first corrected head movement eddy current distortions. binary brain mask generated baseline non-diffusion weighted b equal- 0 image. diffusion tensor models fitted independently voxel within brain mask fractional anisotropy calculated brain voxels. next probabilistic tractography performed native space participant. probabilistic tractography parcellate tracts interest method described elsewhere . briefly method based probability distributions guide multiple fiber samples starting seed voxel specified target region. also method models multiple fiber orientations passing voxel shown robust resolving crossing fibers critical tractography brainstem . tractography performed brainstem mask seed striatum nigrostriatal tract amygdala solitary tract precentral cortex corticospinal tract target regions. brainstem single axial slice approximately end midbrain before pons outline brainstem seed mask individual participant refer supplementary figure s1. target regions regions identified freesurfer analysis participants structural t1 weighted mri data masks described detail . one thousand fiber streamlines generated voxel within seed region reached target region retained final white matter connection. streamlines terminated reached target region. voxels least 40 percent maximum streamlines passing retained part final white matter tract. tractography three tracts interest left right separately performed quality checked visually three authors participants figure 1. mean fa value tract calculated.

10.1371/journal.pone.0088160,Data Analysis,"home-range size. we used aerial vhf telemetry locations from instrumented grizzly bears =2 years of age, with =1 location in june or earlier, =1 location in september, and =10 (<U+200A>=<U+200A> 18.2, range <U+200A>=<U+200A> 10–35) locations annually to estimate annual home ranges. female cohorts included subadults (2–4 yrs), adults with cubs-of-the-year, and other adults (females with yearlings or 2-year-olds and lone adults). we excluded females with unknown reproductive status. male cohorts were subadult (2–4 yrs) and adult. we log-transformed annual home-range estimates to represent a normal distribution.we estimated annual home ranges with 95% a-local convex hull (lch; [34] locoh.a in adehabitathr for r v. 2.14.1, r development core team, www.r-project.org) and 95% minimum convex polygon (mcp) techniques (arcgis v. 10.0, environmental systems research institute, inc., redlands, ca). for the lch method, we used the maximum distance between any 2 locations in each bear’s annual data as the initial a value and then adjusted upward in increments of 0.5 (i.e., 1.5a, 2.0a, 2.5a, 3.0a). we graphed area versus a to choose the optimal value for our home ranges [34]. whereas mcps tend to overestimate home-range size [35], the lch method reduces type i error by excluding unused areas [36]. because detection of changes in home-range size was important to test our hypotheses, we used lch home ranges as our primary data source. we also used the 95% mcp estimates to evaluate the robustness of our findings by examining home ranges at a larger scale.wbp decline. wbp in the gye was mapped in 2009 with data from satellite imagery and historic vegetation maps and updated in 2010 to reflect new information obtained from recent satellite imagery and aerial reconnaissance [37]. this effort used data from land management agencies in the gye and was reclassified to create a consistent geospatial layer of wbp distribution. the extent of mortality of wbp was estimated with the landscape assessment system (las) project, which used aerial transects and aerial photographic evidence to estimate and rank wbp mortality throughout the gye [37], [38]. las rankings ranged from 0 to 6, with rankings =4 generally indicating no live overstory remaining. because the las project was conducted in 2009 and the greatest mortality of mature wbp peaked around 2009 with a decreased mortality rate since [7], [39], we classified 1989–1999 home ranges as pre-impact and 2007–2012 home ranges as impacted, the latter period representing substantially diminished wbp stands. for home ranges during the impact period, we used las data to adjust the proportion of wbp in the home range to account for tree mortality. we assumed that areas mapped as wbp vegetation but with las rankings of =4 represented stands that provided little to no foraging value to grizzly bears, and thus censored those from the proportion of wbp available in the home range. we used geospatial modeling environment [40] to calculate the proportion of wbp available within each grizzly bear’s annual home range.grizzly bear population density. we developed a spatially and temporally explicit index of population density by dividing the gye into 14– × 14-km (196 km2) grid cells, approximately matching the size of annual female home ranges (1975–2001 data; interagency grizzly bear study team, unpublished data). using telemetry locations and life-history of captured bears, we created the density index by back- and forecasting lifetime home ranges to indicate the presence of individuals in the population through space and time. we restricted telemetry data to known-aged individuals of =2 years that were captured for research or management purposes during 1975–2012 (870 individual bears). for bears with known mortality, we forecasted ranges through the year of mortality. for bears with unknown fates, we applied sex-specific survival probabilities (<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.950, <U+200A>=<U+200A>0.925; [3], [4]) to forecast the annual probability they remained in the population. we thus successively reduced the contribution of their annual ranges to the density index according to annual survival rates. we limited lifetime contribution of bears of unknown fates to a maximum age of 30 years [3]. bears are long-lived, so the presence of unmarked bears may go undetected near the end of the sampling period because those bears are less likely to have been captured at the time of analysis. because this would result in underestimation of the density index starting around 2007, we ended the density index in 2006 and used autoregression models ([41]; arima in stats for r v. 2.14.1, r development core team, www.r-project.org) to project the density trend forward for 2007–2012 for each 14– × 14-km grid cell. we based those regressions on the previous 5 years of data (i.e., 2002–2006). because we started with 1983 capture and telemetry records and our pre-impact period began in 1989, we did not need to correct for underestimation bias during the pre-impact period. we calculated the density index for each grid cell in a given year as the sum of proportional overlap of all lifetime activity ranges present during that year (figure s1). we used geospatial modeling environment [40] to calculate the density index values within each grizzly bear’s annual home range. a detailed description of the density index methods is provided in appendix s1.statistical analysis. we tested our hypotheses by comparing a set of a priori models using akaike’s information criterion (aicc) [42]. we standardized independent, numeric variables to place variables on a common scale [43]. we used home-range size as the dependent variable in linear-mixed effects models (lme4 for r v. 2.14.1, r development core team, www.r-project.org), with crossed random intercepts for year and individual bears. we evaluated the random effect structure for our models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. subsequently, we competed models with different fixed effects, but consistent random effect terms, using unrestricted maximum likelihood estimation. because our inference was at the population level and inclusion of the random effects served to model correlation of responses within groups (bears or years), our models are equivalent to linear models with correlated errors; accordingly, we used marginal aicc (maicc), or simply aicc, to test our hypotheses [44]. we analyzed females and males separately because of differences in home-range size [45]. for our model set we used combinations of 4 independent variables and their interactions: cohort, period (pre- and during wbp impact), proportion of wbp in home range, and grizzly bear density in home range. our main treatment was based on the 2 periods and interactions with indices of wbp availability and grizzly bear population density; we used these interactions to test if the relationship between home-range size and population density or home-range size and wbp would be different during the 1989–1999 and 2007–2012 periods. because the wbp and density indices were spatially and temporally explicit, we were also able to test spatial relationships of the two indices with home-range size of individuals, regardless of period. we assessed the importance of model terms by comparing model-averaged beta estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals. home-range estimates may be influenced by sample size, so we included the number of locations as a variable in each model to account for this. we also included the number of locations as a single variable in a separate model to test whether it was more influential than other covariates. we examined relative importance of the relationship with home-range size for the density index versus wbp by calculating the cumulative aicc weights of models that included each respective variable (model set was balanced, with each variable occurring in 6 models with the same combination of covariates). data used in our analyses are provided in appendix

10.1371/journal.pone.0104231,4.1. EXAFS data analysis,"the fourier transform (ft) moduli of k-weighted exafs signals (fig. 3) provide a first qualitative characterization of the local structure around the heme-fe(iii) atom as the ft peaks denote interatomic coordination distances. notably, the ft peak positions appear compressed by roughly 0.5 å with respect to the true interatomic distances due to the phase shift term in the exafs formula (eq. 1) [29]. the fts show an intense first peak around 1.5 å originating mainly from the nearest neighbor heme-fe(iii) coordination shells. moreover, evident peaks are observed up to 4 å and structural modifications occurring around the heme-fe(iii) atom upon ibuprofen and warfarin binding can be hypothesized by examining the differences observed among the drug-free and the drug-bound hsa-heme-fe(iii) (fig. 2).the five-coordination state of the heme-fe(iii) atom observed by x-ray crystallography [21], [22] corresponds to what reported in solution by 17o-nmr spectroscopy [49]. therefore, the crystallographic structure of the hsa-heme-fe(iii) [21], [22] has been used as the starting point for the quantitative exafs data analysis. in the hsa-heme-fe(iii) crystal structure [21], [22], the heme-fe(iii) atom coordination is largely distorted with four heme nitrogen atoms (fe-ni) of the macrocycle at r(fe-ni)~2 å (shell i) and one additional bond with the oxygen phenoxy atom of the tyr161 residue (fe-ot) at r(fe-ot)~2.7 å (shell ii). these shells correspond to the main ft peak around 1.5 å (fig. 3). due to the large difference between r(fe-ni) and r(fe-ot) distances the five-fold coordination state of the heme-fe(iii) atom has been denoted as 4+1-coordination.the bonding geometry of the tyr161 side chain is supposed to be quite flexible, then we hypothesize that the major contribution to the next neighbor ft peaks comes from the heme structure which is relatively rigid. therefore, the eight carbon atoms (c2) form a coordination shell (shell iii) at the average distance r(fe-c2)~3.1 å, and the four carbon atoms (c3) give rise to a coordination shell (shell iv) at the average distance r(fe-c3)~3.4 å (fig. 1). these two shells must produce the second ft peak observed around 3–3.5 å (fig. 3). the third main peak in the ft, observed around 3.8 å, must be associated to the more distant shell of the c4 ions located at r(fe-c4)~4.3 å. noticeably, strong multiple scattering (ms) effects are expected to occur in this region, due to the almost collinear fe(iii)-ni-c4 configurations (bond angle <U+03B8>n1~170°) [50], [51]a good fitting of hsa-heme-fe(iii) exafs data has been obtained by considering the shells i, ii, iii, and iv (without the ms shell), keeping the coordination numbers fixed accordingly to the crystallographic structure of the fa1 site, and refining the average shell distances (rj) and msrd parameters (). attempts to include contributions from the c4 shell in the analysis of the exafs spectra worsened the correlation among the fitting parameters (as also noticed in ref. [51]) and the reliability of the refinement. therefore, the analysis has been restricted to the first four shells excluding the c4 shell, however this does not affect the information about heme-fe(iii) coordination mode.figure 4 shows the k-weighted experimental exafs data () along with the best fit curves (). the contributions used for the refinement, the residual values, and the structural parameters are listed in table 1. the coordination distances of the heme-fe(iii) atom in the hsa-heme-fe(iii) complex are in good agreement with those determined by x-ray crystallography [20], [21], giving confidence on the present analysis. noticeably, the fe-o bond results compressed (r(fe-ot)<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.5 å) with respect to that shown in the crystallographic model (r(fe-ot)<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.78 å) while the fe-c2 shell distance obtained by exafs is slightly (2%) expanded with respect to that reported in the crystallographic model. this discrepancy may reflect the solution and crystal state of hsa-heme-fe(iii). note that in the multiple shell data fitting procedure, the consistency of the structural parameters of the different shells, and the possibility to constraint structural parameters (i.e., energy shift and coordination numbers) to geometrical models is helpful to strength the reliability of the results, specially dealing with relatively noisy data [50]–[53].optical spectroscopy investigations [11], [13], [14], [19], [20] and the smds model (see below) suggest that ibuprofen and warfarin binding would lead to the formation of an additional ligand of the heme-fe(iii) atom. changes observed looking at the xafs data (in particular xanes and fts) highlight drug effects on the local structure of hsa-heme-fe(iii). note that in standard exafs data analysis, the additional neighbor suggested by optical spectroscopy and the smds model can be hindered owing the correlation among the fitting parameters. firstly, the ibuprofen and warfarin bound hsa-heme-fe(iii) exafs data have been analyzed fixing ni<U+200A>=<U+200A>4 and nii<U+200A>=<U+200A>1 and leaving  free to vary with a lower limit at 1/4 of the values found in pure hsa-heme-fe(iii). the best fit shows that  (first shell) systematically reaches the lower limit (imposed to 1×10-3 å2) still providing an unsatisfactory fit (being  and r2 around 0.15; fig. s2 in file s1). secondly, an additional fe-n shell (fe-nb) has been added in order to verify the possibility of the additional heme-fe(iii) neighbor. despite the uncertainty on n(fe-nb) is relatively large (about 50%), this contribution improves the best fit quality giving confidence on this finding. noticeably, the heme-fe(iii) next neighbor distances change weakly upon drug addition but their disorder factors decrease systematically.", fourier transform ft moduli k-weighted exafs signals fig. 3 provide first qualitative characterization local structure around heme-feiii atom ft peaks denote interatomic coordination distances. notably ft peak positions appear compressed roughly 0.5 respect true interatomic distances due phase shift term exafs formula eq. 1 . fts show intense first peak around 1.5 originating mainly nearest neighbour heme-feiii coordination shells. moreover evident peaks observed 4 structural modifications occurring around heme-feiii atom upon ibuprofen warfarin binding can hypothesized examining differences observed among drug-free drug-bound hsa-heme-feiii fig. 2. five-coordination state heme-feiii atom observed x-ray crystallography corresponds reported solution 17o-nmr spectroscopy . therefore crystallographic structure hsa-heme-feiii starting point quantitative exafs data analysis. hsa-heme-feiii crystal structure heme-feiii atom coordination largely distorted four heme nitrogen atoms fe-ni macrocycle rfe-ni2 shell one additional bond oxygen phenoxy atom tyr161 residue fe-ot rfe-ot2.7 shell ii. shells correspond main ft peak around 1.5 fig. 3. due large difference between rfe-ni rfe-ot distances five-fold coordination state heme-feiii atom denoted 4 1-coordination. bonding geometry tyr161 side chain supposed quite flexible hypothesize major contribution next neighbour ft peaks comes heme structure relatively rigid. therefore eight carbon atoms c2 form coordination shell shell iii average distance rfe-c23.1 four carbon atoms c3 give rise coordination shell shell iv average distance rfe-c33.4 fig. 1. two shells must produce second ft peak observed around 3-3.5 fig. 3. third main peak ft observed around 3.8 must associated distant shell c4 ions located rfe-c44.3 . noticeably strong multiple scattering ms effects expected occur region due almost collinear feiii-ni-c4 configurations bond angle theta n1170 good fitting hsa-heme-feiii exafs data obtained considering shells ii iii iv without ms shell keeping coordination numbers fixed accordingly crystallographic structure fa1 site refining average shell distances rj msrd parameters . attempts include contributions c4 shell analysis exafs spectra worsened correlation among fitting parameters also noticed ref. reliability refinement. therefore analysis restricted first four shells excluding c4 shell however affect information heme-feiii coordination mode.figure 4 shows k-weighted experimental exafs data along best fit curves . contributions refinement residual values structural parameters listed table 1. coordination distances heme-feiii atom hsa-heme-feiii complex good agreement determined x-ray crystallography giving confidence present analysis. noticeably fe-o bond results compressed rfe-ot equal- 2.5 respect shown crystallographic model rfe-ot equal- 2.78 fe-c2 shell distance obtained exafs slightly 2 percent expanded respect reported crystallographic model. discrepancy may reflect solution crystal state hsa-heme-feiii. note multiple shell data fitting procedure consistency structural parameters different shells possibility constraint structural parameters .e. energy shift coordination numbers geometrical models helpful strength reliability results specially dealing relatively noisy data-.optical spectroscopy investigations smds model see below suggest ibuprofen warfarin binding lead formation additional ligand heme-feiii atom. changes observed looking xafs data particular xanes fts highlight drug effects local structure hsa-heme-feiii. note standard exafs data analysis additional neighbour suggested optical spectroscopy smds model can hindered owing correlation among fitting parameters. firstly ibuprofen warfarin bound hsa-heme-feiii exafs data analysed fixing ni equal- 4 nii equal- 1 leaving free vary lower limit 14 values found pure hsa-heme-feiii. best fit shows first shell systematically reaches lower limit imposed 110-3 a2 still providing unsatisfactory fit r2 around 0.15 fig. s2 file s1. secondly additional fe-n shell fe-nb added order verify possibility additional heme-feiii neighbour. despite uncertainty nfe-nb relatively large 50 percent contribution improves best fit quality giving confidence finding. noticeably heme-feiii next neighbour distances change weakly upon drug addition disorder factors decrease systematically.

[18]. an eight-segment model consisting of the foot, shank, thigh, pelvis, and trunk was used to estimate whole body com location [19]. note that trunk motion was estimated using the 3d marker positions, which were then used to calculate the segment com using the equations described by winter [19]. whole body com was then calculated by summing the separate segment 3d segments. com sway was used to characterize the magnitude of frontal plane movement of the com and was calculated as the range of com movement in the frontal plane over each gait cycle. temporal (cycle duration and cadence) and spatial (step width) gait parameters were calculated to characterize locomotor adaptations in response to the external com perturbations.locomotor adaptations in com sway and step width in response to the applied perturbations were quantified utilizing three different analyses. responses during the catch trials were compared to the to the average response from the corresponding block. single-cycle perturbation catch trials in the pre and post blocks were compared to the average response across the pull block to assess differences in locomotor adaptions between a single-cycle and prolonged step-by-step perturbations. catch trials in the perturbation block where the perturbation was removed for a single cycle were compared to the average across the pre and post perturbation block to evaluate retention of the adaptation. longer term adaptations over the course of the perturbation block were characterized by comparing the average of the first twenty gait cycles with the final twenty gait cycles of the perturbation block. lastly, we characterized time course of adaptation to the application and removal of perturbations by fitting an exponential curve to the first 20 gait cycles of the perturbation (adaptation) and post perturbation block (de-adaptation). catch trials were removed, trial data was normalized to the average of the pre-block for a given condition, and then averaged across participants, resulting in a value of one representing the baseline value for a given trial. a levenberg-marquardt least squares optimization was used to fit the exponential functions to the data, with the corresponding time constants obtained from these fits used to characterize when the data approached 67% of the steady-state level. all data analysis was completed in matlab.statistical analyses were conducted using spss 20.0 (imb, armonk, ny). paired t-tests were used to compare step width and com sway between the two initial walking conditions, and to assess any differences due to connecting the cables to the participant. the average response was calculated for each testing block (pre, pull, post was obtained by removing catch trials, then taking the mean across the entire block (100 gait cycles). values from the catch trials were averaged within each block (4 gait trials) for statistical analysis. these average values for step width and com sway were compared using a repeated measures anova to characterize within-subject changes due to the experimental factors of force type (destabilizing vs. stabilizing; type), force magnitude (force), handrail hold (hold), and perturbation block (block). a repeated measures anova was also used to compare catch trial responses (step width and com sway) to the corresponding perturbation block response (i.e. catch trials in the perturbation block were compared to the pre and post blocks since no perturbation was applied for any of these cycles). this analysis method enabled the evaluation of potential interaction effects between the testing conditions, such as the influence of handrail hold during the perturbation block. if the data for a certain experimental factor was not spherical, a greenhouse-geisser correction was used for the within-subject effects. post-hoc analyses were carried out for significant factors using a bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. significance was accepted at p<0.05.",video data initially processed vicon nexus software label markers run lower extremity plug--gait model. gait events automatically detected matlab mathworks natick ma custom algorithm combined ground reaction force kinematic event detection methods described zeni et al. . eight-segment model consisting foot shank thigh pelvis trunk estimate whole body com location . note trunk motion estimated 3d marker positions calculate segment com equations described winter . whole body com calculated summing separate segment 3d segments. com sway characterize magnitude frontal plane movement com calculated range com movement frontal plane over gait cycle. temporal cycle duration cadence spatial step width gait parameters calculated characterize locomotor adaptations response external com perturbations.locomotor adaptations com sway step width response applied perturbations quantified utilizing three different analyses. responses catch trials compared average response corresponding block. single-cycle perturbation catch trials pre post blocks compared average response across pull block assess differences locomotor adaptions between single-cycle prolonged step--step perturbations. catch trials perturbation block perturbation removed single cycle compared average across pre post perturbation block evaluate retention adaptation. longer term adaptations over course perturbation block characterized comparing average first twenty gait cycles final twenty gait cycles perturbation block. lastly characterized time course adaptation application removal perturbations fitting exponential curve first 20 gait cycles perturbation adaptation post perturbation block de-adaptation. catch trials removed trial data normalized average pre-block given condition averaged across participants resulting value one representing baseline value given trial. levenberg-marquardt least squares optimization fit exponential functions data corresponding time constants obtained fits characterize data approached 67 percent steady-state level. data analysis completed matlab.statistical analyses conducted spss 20.0 imb armonk ny. paired t-test compare step width com sway between two initial walking conditions assess differences due connecting cables participant. average response calculated testing block pre pull post obtained removing catch trials taking mean across entire block 100 gait cycles. values catch trials averaged within block 4 gait trials statistical analysis. average values step width com sway compared repeated measures anova characterize within-subject changes due experimental factors force type destabilizing vs. stabilizing type force magnitude force handrail hold hold perturbation block block. repeated measures anova also compare catch trial responses step width com sway corresponding perturbation block response .e. catch trials perturbation block compared pre post blocks since perturbation applied cycles. analysis method enabled evaluation potential interaction effects between testing conditions influence handrail hold perturbation block. data certain experimental factor spherical greenhouse-geisser correction within-subject effects. post-hoc analyses carried significant factors bonferroni correction account multiple comparisons. significance accepted p less- 0.05.

10.1371/journal.pone.0164306,Statistical analysis,"the overall 5-year and yearly resistance rates of e. coli to the routinely tested first-line antimicrobials on over 4,000 isolates (ampicillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cephalexin/cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim) were calculated by dividing the number of urinary e. coli isolates resistant to each antimicrobial by the number of isolates tested against an individual antimicrobial agent. for the isolates which were sent for further susceptibility testing on vitek2 against second-line antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and nitrofurantoin), the denominator used in calculating the resistance rates was the total number of isolates included in the study. this denominator was used based on the assumption that isolates were initially not tested for the vitek2 antibiotics because they were considered highly unlikely to be resistant to these antibiotics. hence in order not to overestimate the resistance rates of these isolates the denominator included all isolates tested on both antibiotic discs and vitek2. the binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (ci) of the resistance percentages were calculated. the 5-year resistance rates were compared for community- and hospital-acquired isolates. the chi-square test was used to check for statistically significant differences in amr between both groups. mean differences in age between the two groups were tested using student’s t-tests. a time series analysis was performed separately for all antimicrobials tested to identify patterns in resistance (trends and seasonal variation) over the five year period. seasonality is a pattern that shows periodic repetitive fluctuations over time. an autoregressive (ar) model was constructed to assess time-varying resistance patterns (i.e., resistance is non-stationary, or changing, over time) and multiple time series models were fitted to also account for age and sex. the analysis on age and sex followed an ecological study design because these variables were aggregated for each season. the dickey-fuller (df) and the augmented dickey-fuller (adf) tests were used to assess a unit root in the time series data. both df and adf statistics are negative numbers; the more negative, the stronger the rejection of the null hypothesis (that there is unit root at some level of confidence). these unit root tests investigate whether a time series variable (e.g., resistance) is non-stationary using the ar model [20]. urinary e. coli isolates for which the antimicrobial showed an intermediate susceptibility category (amoxycillin-clavulanate, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin) were excluded from the final analysis. a significance level of p < 0.05 was used. data were analysed using stata statistical software (version 13, statacorp).", overall 5-year yearly resistance rates e. coli routinely tested first-line antimicrobials over 4000 isolates ampicillin amoxycillin-clavulanate cephalexincefazolin ciprofloxacin gentamicin nalidixic acid trimethoprim calculated dividing number urinary e. coli isolates resistant antimicrobial number isolates tested against individual antimicrobial agent. isolates sent susceptibility testing vitek2 against second-line antimicrobials ceftriaxone trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole meropenem piperacillin-tazobactam nitrofurantoin denominator calculating resistance rates total number isolates included study. denominator based assumption isolates initially tested vitek2 antibiotics considered highly unlikely resistant antibiotics. hence order overestimate resistance rates isolates denominator included isolates tested antibiotic discs vitek2. binomial exact 95 percent confidence intervals ci resistance percentages calculated. 5-year resistance rates compared community- hospital-acquired isolates. chi-square test check statistically significant differences amr between groups. mean differences age between two groups tested student t-test. time series analysis performed separately antimicrobials tested identify patterns resistance trends seasonal variation over five year period. seasonality pattern shows periodic repetitive fluctuations over time. autoregressive ar model constructed assess time-varying resistance patterns .e. resistance non-stationary changing over time multiple time series models fitted also account age sex. analysis age sex followed ecological study design variables aggregated season. dickey-fuller df augmented dickey-fuller adf tests assess unit root time series data. df adf statistics negative numbers negative stronger rejection null hypothesis unit root level confidence. unit root tests investigate whether time series variable e.g. resistance non-stationary ar model . urinary e. coli isolates antimicrobial showed intermediate susceptibility category amoxycillin-clavulanate trimethoprim ciprofloxacin excluded final analysis. significance level p less- 0.05 . data analysed stata statistical software version 13 statacorp.

10.1371/journal.pone.0033811,Statistical analyses,"differences in the spatial distribution of male and female black-tailed godwits in the tagus estuary were assessed by comparing, with a chi-squared test, the number of individuals of each sex observed in each of the five study areas throughout the whole study period. to investigate differences in the individual site-fidelity (sfi) between male and female godwits we used a t-test.the relationship between dietary composition (measured as the proportional contribution to diet of each prey type, expressed in terms of biomass consumed), and the sex and culmen length of individual godwits was investigated using generalized linear mixed model (glmm). fitted by maximizing restricted log-likelihood [42]. one model was built for each one of the three prey types consumed. prey density in the sediment (number of prey items/m2, obtained from the invertebrate sampling) was included as a control variable, given that the consumption of a particular prey is likely to be linked with its availability. we also included in the models the variable “date”, defined as the number of days elapsed since the first of october (each year), to control for potential variation in consumption of each prey during the course of both winters. these models used a binomial error distribution with a logit link function.glmms were also used to test the effect of godwit sex and culmen length on the average size of s. plana and h.diversicolor consumed (using the average prey size index), and again prey density and date were set as covariates. for prey size, the models used a gaussian error distribution with an identity link function.in all glmms, the inclusion of both sex and culmen length enabled us to test the relationships within each particular sex. given that most of the data obtained on foraging godwits consists of repeated observations over the same individuals, bird identity was included as a random factor. models were initially fitted with all predictors and their interactions and then compared with increasingly simpler nested models with similar random structure, constructed by deletion of the non-significant fixed term until only significant terms (p<0.05) remained in the model. comparisons between models were based on log-likelihood ratio tests [43].microhabitat use by male and female godwits was compared using compositional analysis [44]. given that the individual frequencies of occurrence in different habitat types (no water, water below knee and water above knee) always sum to 1 and are not inter-independent (unit-sum constraint), we used an isometric log-ratio transformation, which converts proportions into real coordinates, while preserving relevant metric properties. these transformed data were then entered in a multivariate analysis of variance (manova), with sex as a fixed factor.in order to compare the frequency of occurrence of agonistic interactions between male and female godwits and the proportion of interactions won by each sex-class, glmms were fitted using a binomial error distribution and a logit link function, with individual-identity as random factor.all

10.1371/journal.pone.0092745,Scan statistics method,"the scan statistics method is used to detect the clusters in a point process or to test whether a one-dimensional point process is purely random [36]. the spatial scan statistics method proposed by kulldorff [25], [37], [38] was used to detect local clusters. a purely spatial analysis based on the poisson model was used to explore the annual purely spatial clusters of hfmd incidence. the purely spatial scan statistic imposes a circular (or elliptical) window, which is centered on each geographical area throughout the study region. the radius of the window varies continuously in size according to the variations in population size in the area. the poisson model assumes that the number of hfmd cases in each location follows a poisson distribution. under the null hypothesis, and when there are no covariates, the number of expected cases in each location is proportional to the population size. the poisson model probability function is presented in equation 4 [38], where  is the size of the entire study area,  is a subzone of ,  is the number of observed cases in , is the probability for observed cases inside , is the probability for observed cases outside , and  is the population size at risk. (4)poisson approximation is especially useful when covariates can be included in the analysis [38]. the covariates age and gender were included in our analysis. the age-gender distribution of the hfmd cases and of the general population varied widely at the township level. local clusters changed after adjusting for age and gender, which helped reveal hidden factors leading to local clusters. the number of expected cases was measured using the indirect standardization method presented above (equation 3).we used the space-time permutation model for the early detection of disease outbreaks, which uses only numbers of cases to detect space-time clusters of hfmd occurrence[39]–[41]. this model is defined using a minimal number of assumptions about the time, geographical location, and size of an outbreak, and adjusts for natural purely spatial and purely temporal variation. it is an important tool and is used for early disease detection by local and national health department surveillance systems. the space-time permutation model uses the probability function presented in equation 5 [39], where  is the total number of observed cases,  is the number of observed cases at area, , during day, , is the number of observed cases in a specific cylinder, , with a circular geographical base, and a height corresponding to time (the number of days). (5)the null hypothesis for the two probability models is that the rate (poisson model) or the independence of the cases in space and time (space-time permutation model) is the same within, and outside of, the scanning window. a likelihood ratio and the relative risk are calculated to test the hypothesis for each scanning window. the p-value for the detected clusters is evaluated using monte carlo simulation. the scanning window with the maximum likelihood is considered to be the most likely cluster. the other windows for which the likelihood value is statistically significant are defined as the secondary clusters, and are ranked according to their likelihood ratio test statistics. scan statistics analyses were performed using satscan v9.1.1 software (boston, ma, usa) [42]. arcgis v10.1 (esri, redlands, ca, usa) was used to visualize the results of the scan statistical analysis.", scan statistics method detect clusters point process test whether one-dimensional point process purely random . spatial scan statistics method proposed kulldorff detect local clusters. purely spatial analysis based poisson model explore annual purely spatial clusters hfmd incidence. purely spatial scan statistic imposes circular elliptical window centred geographical area throughout study region. radius window varies continuously size according variations population size area. poisson model assumes number hfmd cases location follows poisson distribution. under null hypothesis covariates number expected cases location proportional population size. poisson model probability function presented equation 4 size entire study area subzone number observed cases probability observed cases inside probability observed cases outside population size risk. 4poisson approximation especially useful covariates can included analysis . covariates age gender included analysis. age-gender distribution hfmd cases general population varied widely township level. local clusters changed after adjusting age gender helped reveal hidden factors leading local clusters. number expected cases measured indirect standardization method presented above equation 3. space-time permutation model early detection disease outbreaks uses numbers cases detect space-time clusters hfmd occurrence-. model defined minimal number assumptions time geographical location size outbreak adjusts natural purely spatial purely temporal variation. important tool early disease detection local national health department surveillance systems. space-time permutation model uses probability function presented equation 5 total number observed cases number observed cases area day number observed cases specific cylinder circular geographical base height corresponding time number days. 5the null hypothesis two probability models rate poisson model independence cases space time space-time permutation model within outside scanning window. likelihood ratio relative risk calculated test hypothesis scanning window. p-value detected clusters evaluated monte carlo simulation. scanning window maximum likelihood considered likely cluster. windows likelihood value statistically significant defined secondary clusters ranked according likelihood ratio test statistics. scan statistics analyses performed satscan v9.1.1 software boston ma usa . arcgis v10.1 esri redlands ca usa visualize results scan statistical analysis.

10.1371/journal.pone.0099624,Statistical analyses,"the goal of our analyses was to address the outlined questions about the numerical responses of saproxylic beetles in the study region to the changes in dead wood availability caused by the moth outbreak. the availability of dead wood was represented by our classification of forest damage, i.e. living forest (normal background levels of dead wood) and dead forest (greatly elevated availability of dead wood owing the moth outbreak). since there was an abrupt shift from living to dead forest along the transects, we also expected that beetle communities would show rather sharp (i.e. non-gradual) spatial changes when moving from one forest type to the other. therefore, we assumed that spatial changes in the beetle community between living and dead forest were adequately modelled by a categorical living-dead contrast. the possibility of additional spatial patterns in the data was assessed by plotting station-specific beetle counts as well as topographical parameters along the transects.forest damage (dead or living) was the focal predictor variable in all analyses. in addition, all models included the categorical predictors year (2011 or 2012) and location (kirkenes or tana), to account for variation in beetle communities between study years and transects. within each year, beetle counts were pooled across the entire trapping season and the three individual traps within each station, resulting in a single datapoint per station, per year. all analyses were conducted separately for the three dwa groups, owing to their different degrees of association with dead wood. for the two saproxylic groups, the analyses only included species which are known to be associated with birch and which could therefore be expected to respond numerically to the dead birch wood left by the outbreak.we performed quantitatively oriented univariate analyses to assess the magnitude of the numerical responses of saproxylic beetles to the dead wood generated by the moth outbreak. first, we assessed whether the total abundances of the different dwa groups (pooled abundance across all species within each group) differed between dead and living forest. this was done by fitting log-linear models with the station-specific individual-counts of each dwa group as response variables, and forest damage, year, location and their two-way interactions as predictors. all models employed quasi-likelihood correction for overdispersion. we used the akaike information criterion, corrected for small sample size and overdispersion (qaicc), to select the best model for each dwa group. the minimal models included only the main effect of the focal predictor forest damage.we also investigated if the proportion that each dwa group constituted, out of the total number of individuals across all groups, differed between dead and living forest. this was done by fitting logistic regression models with the station-specific proportions of each dwa group as response variables. we employed the same predictor variables and model selection strategy for this analysis as for the analysis of the total counts of dwa groups (above).to assess numerical responses to dead wood availability in the most important saproxylic beetle species, we fitted log-linear models to the station-specific counts of all species which were judged to be sufficiently abundant for statistical modelling (total count >80 individuals). the predictor variables and model selection strategy for these species-specific models were the same as for the models fitted to the total counts of the dwa groups (above).finally, we used multivariate methods to investigate how beetle community structure varied between living and dead forest. in order to assess overall community-responses to the outbreak, the multivariate models were run not only for the three dwa groups, but also collectively for all species in the data. all beetle counts were hellinger transformed before multivariate analysis [42].we performed redundancy analysis (rda) (rda function in the r package vegan) to allow visualization and significance-testing of the effects of forest damage, year and location on beetle community structure. we assumed additive effects of the three predictors, since inclusion of interactions did not change the conclusions from the analysis. the significance of the marginal effects of the predictors (i.e. effects after accounting for all other predictors in the models) was assessed with permutational anova (anova.cca function in the r package vegan) with a maximum of 9999 permutations. site scores from the rdas were displayed on biplots in order to investigate how the beetle communities of the individual sampling stations were organized with respect to the predictor variables.variance partitioning (varpart function in the r package vegan) was used to estimate how much of the variance in beetle community structure was explained by the focal predictor forest damage, as well as year and location. the results of the variance partitioning were visualised with venn diagrams, fitted with the venneuler function in the r package with the same name. negative variance fractions were treated as zeros.", goal analyses address outlined questions numerical responses saproxylic beetles study region changes dead wood availability caused moth outbreak.

[47]. genetic ancestry analysis based on indel data (aims) was carried out with admixture software [48], which uses a maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries from multilocus genotypes. this software was used to estimate percentages of admixture in the yungas to a continental level considering three main continental groups (sub-saharan africa, native americans, and europeans) represented by 327 samples from the human genome diversity cell line panel (hgdp-ceph). note that ancestry inferences for individuals have to be considered with care owing to the variability of estimates when using a limited number of aims [49], but inferences based on population samples can be very robust, even when using a limited number of individuals [26,49].for multidimensional scaling (mds) we used the software plink 1.07 [50] and r v.3.0.2 (http://www.r-project.org). we first created an allele-sharing genetic distance matrix to calculate the identical by state (ibs) values between pairs of individuals.admixture analysis was additionally carried out on bolivian l-mtdna haplotypes (‘afro-bolivian’) in order to allocate the variability observed in the most likely source population in africa. an admixture analysis based on haplogroup frequencies, as performed in [15], was not possible given the limited number of bolivian l-mtdnas, which does not allow realistic inferences of frequency estimates. therefore, we carried out an analysis based on haplotype sharing [51], which is an extension of previous proposals [7,52], by allowing step-mutation differences between ‘afro-bolivian’ haplotypes and the source populations. a database of >13,700 african profiles was used and six different sub-continental source regions were considered: north (n = 3,830), west-central (n = 6,868), southwest (n = 522), south (n = 357); southeast (n = 1,118), and east (n = 1,010) africa (s6 table).",diversity indices computed mtdna sequences obtained dnasp v.5. . genetic ancestry analysis based indel data aims carried admixture software uses maximum likelihood estimation individual ancestries multilocus genotypes. software estimate percentages admixture yungas continental level considering three main continental groups sub-saharan africa native americans europeans represented 327 samples human genome diversity cell line panel hgdp-ceph. note ancestry inferences individuals considered care owing variability estimates limited number aims inferences based population samples can robust even limited number individuals 2649. multidimensional scaling mds software plink 1.07 r v.3.0.2 httpwww.r-project.org. first created allele-sharing genetic distance matrix calculate identical state ibs values between pairs individuals.admixture analysis additionally carried bolivian l-mtdna haplotypes afro-bolivian order allocate variability observed likely source population africa. admixture analysis based haplogroup frequencies performed possible given limited number bolivian l-mtdnas allow realistic inferences frequency estimates. therefore carried analysis based haplotype sharing extension previous proposals 752 allowing step-mutation differences between afro-bolivian haplotypes source populations. database greater- 13700 african profiles six different sub-continental source regions considered north n equal- 3830 west-central n equal- 6868 southwest n equal- 522 south n equal- 357 southeast n equal- 1118 east n equal- 1010 africa s6 table.
