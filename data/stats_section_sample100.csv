[26] in brief, the it framework evaluates a set of plausible scientific hypotheses, and uses the relative strengths of information considered across all models to obtain model-averaged parameter estimates, instead of selecting a single model based on traditional model selection techniques. in so doing, after fitting all of the models of interest to each outcome (with differing combinations of health behavior predictors and interactions), results are combined across models in proportion to the relative strength of information each model contributes [26]. the it framework also offers advantages over a traditional model selection approach (e.g., forward or backward selection), in that it allows comparison of fits across all models and reduces over-estimation of effect sizes compared to standard models.",fcas mind questionnaires added study after baseline accordingly health behaviour measures obtained first visit health behaviour data available participant median equal-to visit 5. set health behaviour predictors cross-sectional time-invariant cognitive outcome measures longitudinal.given goal characterizing combined influences multiple health behaviour predictors related interactions opted information theoretic modelling technique detailed group previous work. brief framework evaluates set plausible scientific hypotheses uses relative strengths information considered across models obtain model-averaged parameter estimates instead selecting single model based traditional model selection techniques. after fitting models interest outcome differing combinations health behaviour predictors interactions results combined across models proportion relative strength information model contributes . framework also offers advantages over traditional model selection approach e.g. forward backward selection allows comparison fits across models reduces over-estimation effect sizes compared standard models.

10.1371/journal.pone.0061725,Statistical Analysis,"a participant could not be certified as healed until he was examined by one of the study clinicians. the number of post-operative days elapsed at the time of certified complete healing was recorded for each individual. clinic visits proceeded after certified complete healing and as such it was possible for a participant to be certified as completely healed at one visit and not be certified as completely healed at the next visit. this scenario occurred in 11 of 323 individuals. for analysis purposes, an individual could not be considered completely healed until he was certified healed at all subsequent visits. censored individuals were those that were either lost-to-follow-up before certified healing or that completed the full 12 weeks of follow-up without accomplishing complete healing, which occurred in just one individual.we performed two separate series of analyses. first, we examined the relationship between hiv-status and time to complete healing in an age-matched cohort of 108 hiv-positive and 108 hiv-negative individuals. second, we examined time to healing in 215 hiv-negative men. our sample size of 108 pairs was sufficient to detect a 12% or greater difference in the proportion of completely healed men between the two groups at alpha<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.05 and power<U+200A>=<U+200A>80%. kaplan-meier methods were used to assess time to complete wound healing in the matched cohort stratified by hiv-status. cox proportional hazard models were used in both series to examine the relationship between a priori identified potentially important covariates and the hazard of healing at any time point. these covariates fall into four categories: demographic, biological, behavioral, and surgical. demographic characteristics considered were age and marital status. biological characteristics were: hiv-status, hsv2 status, baseline random blood sugar, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and the presence of a post-operative infection in the first 3 weeks of follow-up. behavioral characteristics were: baseline alcohol consumption (days/week), physical activity in the first week following surgery (riding a bicycle, digging, and walking long distances), and time of onset of sexual activity. surgical characteristics were: amount of dermis exposed at week 1 (in total mm), evidence of tight sutures at week 1, surgical time as a proxy for difficult surgery, and surgeon cadre (clinical officer vs. nurse counselor).we investigated each of the covariates individually in separate univariate models to explore the reduction in -2 log likelihoods using a one-degree of freedom chi-square test. covariates significantly reducing the model deviance at the p<0.05 level were then included in a multivariate cox proportional hazard model. covariates failing to meet this criterion were dropped from further analysis with the exception of the primary exposures of interest: hiv-status for matched analysis and age for hiv-negative analysis. we applied this strategy with both the age-matched analysis of hiv-positive and hiv-negative men and with the analysis of hiv-negative men only. in each analysis, we modeled the hazard of healing and thus hazard ratios less than 1.0 are indicative of delayed healing. analyses were performed using sas version 9.2 (sas

computing, vienna, austria).in view of redundancy and homology in the lactobacillus peptide databases, we applied additional criteria based on 16s rdna microarray data to ensure species specificity of lactobacillus proteins. these criteria were based on the assumption that proteins with high relative abundance in samples with only one highly abundant lactobacillus sp. originated from that lactobacillus species. taken together, the strict criteria to classify proteins as l. iners proteins were: 1) the best match in the mascot search was a l. iners or ‘lactobacillus multispecies’ protein, 2) the mean ion intensity in women with a l. iners-dominated vmb was at least 2-fold higher, and the median ion intensity was equal to or higher than in women with no l. iners as determined by 16s rdna microarray (i.e. women with a l. crispatus-dominated vmb and women with vmb dysbiosis without l. iners). similar criteria were used for classification of l. crispatus proteins, with the difference that women without l. crispatus were used as a reference group (i.e. women with a l. iners-dominated vmb or women with vmb dysbiosis without l. crispatus). proteins initially identified as ‘lactobacillus multispecies’ proteins were thus used in the classification of both l. iners and l. crispatus proteins, but could only be classified as a protein from one out of both lactobacillus species.only samples with positive 16s results for l. iners and/or l. crispatus within each group were included in subsequent comparative l. iners/l. crispatus protein analyses. the l. crispatus-dominated vmb cluster (n = 7) included 5 women with positive 16s rdna microarray results for l. crispatus and 2 samples that had negative results for l. crispatus- and l. iners 16s rdna (but had l. jensenii or l. gasseri, and similarly low bacterial diversity and low abundance of dysbiosis-associated bacteria to be clustered together with women with a l. crispatus-dominated vmb [13]). in the l. iners-dominated cluster (n = 11), 7 women had positive results for l. iners and 4 positive results for l. iners and l. crispatus. in the moderately dysbiotic cluster (n = 14), 10 women had positive results for l. iners, 2 for l. iners and l. crispatus, and 2 tested negative for lactobacillus 16s rdna. in the severely dysbiotic cluster (n = 18), 7 women had positive results for l. iners, 1 for l. crispatus, 1 for l. iners and l. crispatus, and 9 tested negative for lactobacilli.relative protein abundance for each identified l. iners and l. crispatus protein was compared among vmb groups and among vaginal ph categories, using two-sided mann-whitney pairwise tests. we used three vaginal ph categories (4–5, 5–6, and =6, respectively) in the l. iners protein analyses, but only two (4–5 and =5, respectively) in the l. crispatus protein analyses due to the small sample sizes. analyses of l. iners proteins were also stratified for l. iners abundance (using two categories: below or above the median s/b ratio) to differentiate between changes in l. iners protein abundance due to changes in l. iners abundance or for other reasons. for l. iners proteins that were statistically

10.1371/journal.pone.0187496,Statistical analyses,"to assess root responses, we analyzed the root morphology and nutrient concentration in root over the two compartments of each pot. we used anova to test the effects on the root morphology and root nutrient concentration with competition (with competitor vs. without competitor), nutrient heterogeneity (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), fertilization (no fertilizer vs. fertilizer) and compartment (competitive vs. non-competitive compartment) as fixed factors and the root morphology and root nutrient concentration as dependent variables. furthermore, post hoc tukey’s hsd test in spss was used to analyze the effect of the treatment on the root morphology and nutrient accumulation for each compartment separately.in addition, the effects of nutrient accumulation in shoots were measured by using anova with competition (with competitor vs. without competitor), nutrient heterogeneity (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), and fertilization (no fertilizer vs. fertilizer) as fixed factors and the nutrient accumulation in shoots as the dependent variable. post hoc tukey’s hsd test in spss was used to analyze the effect of treatment on nutrient accumulation in shoots.we also used the ratio between the value of the different order root morphology variables in the competitive compartment and those in the non-competitive compartment of the same pot (e.g., srl ratio = srlcompetitive half/srl non-competitive half for srl ratio) to evaluate the root response to competition for each treatment in sub-experimentii[21]. a t-test was performed to analyze the difference between the ratio and a value of 1 based on a comparison of the confidence intervals of the ratio. when the ratio was equal to 1, we considered that root growth was symmetrical and unaffected by its neighbors. a ratio <1 indicated that competition had a negative effect on roots, and a ratio >1 indicated that competition had a positive effect on roots.finally, to measure the correlation of nutrient concentration with root morphology when a competitor and nutrient heterogeneity were present simultaneously, a bivariate correlation was conducted to analyze the correlation between the accumulation of root nutrients and root morphology in non-competitive compartments and competitive compartments of sub-experimentii, respectively. all statistical tests were performed using spss version 11.5.",assess root responses analysed root morphology nutrient concentration root over two compartments pot. anova test effects root morphology root nutrient concentration competition competitor vs. without competitor nutrient heterogeneity homogeneous vs. heterogeneous fertilization fertilizer vs. fertilizer compartment competitive vs. non-competitive compartment fixed factors root morphology root nutrient concentration dependent variables. furthermore post-hoc tukey hsd test spss analyse effect treatment root morphology nutrient accumulation compartment separately.in addition effects nutrient accumulation shoots measured anova competition competitor vs. without competitor nutrient heterogeneity homogeneous vs. heterogeneous fertilization fertilizer vs. fertilizer fixed factors nutrient accumulation shoots dependent variable. post-hoc tukey hsd test spss analyse effect treatment nutrient accumulation shoots.we also ratio between value different order root morphology variables competitive compartment non-competitive compartment pot e.g. srl ratio equal-to srlcompetitive halfsrl non-competitive half srl ratio evaluate root response competition treatment sub-experimentii. t-test performed analyse difference between ratio value 1 based comparison confidence intervals ratio. ratio equal-to 1 considered root growth symmetrical unaffected neighbours. ratio less-than 1 indicated competition negative effect roots ratio greater-than 1 indicated competition positive effect roots.finally measure correlation nutrient concentration root morphology competitor nutrient heterogeneity present simultaneously bivariate correlation conducted analyse correlation between accumulation root nutrients root morphology non-competitive compartments competitive compartments sub-experimentii respectively. statistical tests performed spss version 11.5.
10.1371/journal.pone.0192737,Data analyses,"before beginning analyses, we projected opportunistic sightings and telemetry locations to the north america equidistant conic projection and used north american datum of 1983. also, we divided datasets into equally-sized analysis windows along the y-axis (i.e., north-south). we tested multiple window heights from 50 to 700 km at 50 km increments. our goal was to find an analysis window that produced a migration corridor providing a good fit to the data with the least complex shape (i.e., concurrently maximize data fit and smoothing) in order to avoid overfitting corridor models. for this fitting process, we estimated a 95% core area (methods described below) and used 1,000 bootstrap estimates to determine which resulting migration corridors using window heights from 50 to 700 km contained 95% of data, meeting our criterion for data fit. we determined shape complexity of migration corridors using fractal dimension index [25]. this index ranges from values of 1–2, and we were interested in minimizing this value, as lower values represent less complex shapes.initially, we defined separate migration corridors using opportunistic sightings from 1942–2016 and telemetry data from 2010–2016 (s1 fig). within analysis windows of size determined based on above criteria, we calculated percentiles of the coordinates’ easting (i.e., x dimension) that corresponded to the 50% core (i.e., area between 25th and 75th percentiles), 75% core (i.e., area between 12.5th and 87.5th percentiles), and 95% core (i.e., area between 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). federal agencies tasked with managing whooping cranes identified these core areas and corresponding percentiles as most useful for current and future conservation and recovery efforts as well as consistency with past corridor designations [15]. we combined percentiles derived from separate opportunistic and telemetry datasets by calculating averages, weighted by dataset-specific sample sizes from each analysis window. we connected final percentile vertices together to form lines outlining western and eastern extents of corridors. we converted these lines to a polygon that represented 50, 75, and 95% core migration corridors. after estimating point estimate percentiles within each analysis window, we generated 95% confidence limits by bootstrapping opportunistic and telemetry datasets 1,000 times, averaging point estimate percentiles, and extracting 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as lower and upper confidence limits for each associated point estimate. we created polygons based on these confidence limit values as described above to define areas of uncertainty.we explored long-term changes in the migration corridor location and characteristics by conducting analyses along the corridor using opportunistic sightings and telemetry locations and the same window width as in developing migration corridor polygons. because of potential bias in opportunistic sightings [15,26], we initially compared medians derived from each dataset in overlapping years (2010–2016) at each analysis window. we estimated 95% confidence limits for these median differences by extracting 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of 1,000 bootstrapped estimates at each analysis window.using a bayesian framework we explored temporal changes in characteristics of the whooping crane corridor. within this framework, we considered opportunistic sightings as prior information, as they had been collected over numerous decades, but may have inherent biases [26]. we used this ‘prior’ information and the likelihood of the telemetry data to estimate posterior probability distributions, which we used as inference. initially, we used a general linear model to explain variation in east-west position of opportunistic sightings over time (proc genmod, sas institute, inc., carey, north carolina, usa). the x-coordinate of each sighting served as response variable, year of sighting as a continuous explanatory variable (year 0 = 1942), and analysis window as a categorical variable. we evoked a bayesian analysis with the bayes statement, which used markov chain monte carlo methods with gibbs sampling (2,000 burn-in and 10,000 markov chain samples). we used an uninformative uniform prior to analyze opportunistic sightings. we calculated means and variances from posterior probability distributions of each parameter, and used these means and variances to define parameter priors as normal distributions in a subsequent and final analysis using telemetry locations. we used 95% credible intervals from posterior distributions of slope parameters for year of sighting (i.e., rates of change) to determine if values were different from 0 due to chance alone. we also investigated temporal changes in migration corridor width by determining median corridor location based on opportunistic and telemetry data and then calculating distance of each location from this centerline to points overall and distance west or east of the line. we used the bayesian framework described above to test for changes in the absolute value of distance from the centerline overall and separately for locations west and east of centerline. for display, we calculated point estimates of model predictions for years 1980 and 2014, which represented 10th and 90th percentiles of sightings by observation year.unless otherwise noted, we calculated average widths of corridors, confidence bands, and other summaries using the 13 analysis windows as sample points. we used arcgis 10.5.1 (esri, inc., redlands, california, usa) for geospatial analyses and sas 9.4 (sas institute, inc., carey, north carolina, usa) for all other summarizations and calculations. data used in this analysis and geospatial data of whooping crane migration corridors depicted in fig 1 are available in the public domain from the usgs sciencebase
