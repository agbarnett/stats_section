# Potential papers to cite

* "Who is afraid of non-normal data? Choosing between parametric and non-parametric tests" DOI: 10.1530/EJE-19-0922. Mentions typical stats section.
* "Why we need to report more than 'Data were Analyzed by t-tests or ANOVA'" DOI:10.7554/eLife.36163
* "Reporting of statistical regression analyses in Biom√©dica: A critical assessment review". DOI: 10.7705/biomedica.v38i0.3648. Could look at other reporting papers too.
* "Common statistical and research design problems in manuscripts submitted to high-impact medical journals" DOI: 10.1186/1756-0500-4-304. Editors of medical journals mentioned the common issue of inadequately described methods
* "An instrument to assess the statistical intensity of medical research papers" https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186882. Possibly worth mentioning in the discussion as an example of a paper that's try to classify stats methods.
* "Statistical Trends in the Journal of the American Medical Association and Implications for Training across the Continuum of Medical Education" https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077301. Useful if we mention complexity in methods over time.
* "Cargo-cult statistics and scientific crisis". DOI: 10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01174.x. Mentions problems with reliance of software. Useful quote: "practitioners go through the motions of fitting models, computing p-values or confidence intervals, or simulating posterior distributions. They invoke statistical terms and procedures as incantations, with scant understanding of the assumptions or relevance of the calculations, or even the meaning of the terminology."
* Only a tweet, but bemoans a very short stats methods section: https://twitter.com/statsepi/status/1246354209173356545 "Data were analyzed using Matlab scripts."
* "How often do leading biomedical journals use statistical experts to evaluate statistical methods? The results of a survey" https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239598
