the correct match image in a trial. we first checked whether each participant could identify individual macaques at above chance levels, by conducting one sample t-tests separately for each person to assess whether their response scores on the 12 individual discrimination trials differed from zero. all exhibited positive mean scores, and 56 of 59 participants (94.9%) succeeded (three tests failed to reach significance; all other p-values =0.033). however, there was no significant correlation between participants' mean response scores in the individual discrimination and kin discrimination trials (pearson correlation, r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.04, n<U+200A>=<U+200A>59, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.791). inspection of the data also revealed that there was no consistent difference between the mean kin discrimination scores of these particular three subjects and the others. as performance in the two types of task was not correlated, all participants were retained for the subsequent kin discrimination analyses.previous experience working with nonhuman primates was entered as a binary variable in all models (see below), as there was no correlation between the participants' duration of previous experience (in months, six categories) and either mean individual discrimination (spearman correlation: rs<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.19, n<U+200A>=<U+200A>59, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.154) or mean kin

possessed previous experience had higher response scores than those without (mean ± sd: experts <U+200A>=<U+200A>0.76±0.331, inexperienced <U+200A>=<U+200A>0.57±0.270; t(57) <U+200A>=<U+200A>2.25, p<0.029).generalized linear mixed models [66] with gaussian error and identity link were used to investigate whether response scores in the kin discrimination task differed significantly from zero (i.e. chance performance – no consistent preference for either the related or unrelated match). note that the way in which response scores were coded leads to the intercept being the critical term in the model; a positive and significant intercept demonstrates that participants prefer the related (offspring) over the unrelated (decoy) image. line (paternal versus maternal kin line), triad type (same- or mixed-sex) and previous experience (yes/no) were included as the main fixed effects, together with the key interaction term of line*triad type. the three-way interaction for line*triad type*experience (plus its remaining lower-order constituent terms) was also included. we checked for any influence of participant gender, trial position in the sequence (in case longitudinal effects of increasing familiarization with the task, or alternatively fatigue effects, were present), and the position in which the correct match was presented onscreen in a given trial (left or right), by including these “control” variables as fixed effects, together with the interaction term for trial position*experience. values for trial position (covariate) were z-transformed beforehand to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. glmms for the individual discrimination task followed a similar format, but triad sex (all-male vs all-female) was the main fixed effect, and hence the only interaction terms were triad sex*experience and trial position*experience.participant identity, image triad identity, and the identity of the images used as the target, left match and right match in each case, were always included as random effects. to control for the possibility that subjects might differ in how their performance changes over the course of the experiment (trial position), and that such subject-specific changes might depend on an individual's overall performance, the initial kin discrimination glmm included the terms for random slopes of performance against trial position within subjects and for an intercept-slope correlation across subjects [67]. the fit of this model did not differ significantly from a reduced model without the correlation term (likelihood ratio test, <U+03C7>2<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.61, d.f. <U+200A>=<U+200A>1, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.204), which was therefore removed before testing for an effect of the random slopes component, which also proved nonsignificant (<U+03C7>2<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.67, d.f.<U+200A>=<U+200A>1, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.412). our full model therefore uses a random effects structure that accounts only for random intercepts.our approach entailed first establishing the overall significance of the full kin discrimination model [68], as compared with a null model (here, one that excludes the main predictors of interest and participant experience and their interactions). having demonstrated significance of the full model, we checked for significant predictors by first dropping all non-significant interaction terms, and then the non-significant main effects (factors showing nonsignificant trends were retained). this produces a final model that retains all the fixed effect(s) of primary interest, together with any main effects or interactions that were significant. at each stage, the fit of the current model was compared with that of the reduced version using a likelihood ratio test. as the main goal is to test whether the overall intercept is significantly positive, the model was then re-run with all nonsignificant fixed effects excluded (if a factor had a significant effect, this test was performed separately for each of the factor's levels).glmm analyses were performed using r v. 2.9.2 [69], using the function “lmer” provided by the library “lme4” [70], and all other analyses using ibm spss v. 19.0. all tests were two-tailed with the alpha level set at p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.05. to achieve a more reliable p-value in glmms, models were fitted using maximum likelihood rather than restricted maximum likelihood [71]. in glmms, p-values were calculated using markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) simulations [66] using the function “pvals.fnc” from the r package “languager” [72]. if a pmcmc value obtained was very close to 0.05, its accuracy was improved by increasing the number of simulations used from 10,000 to 100,000.",responses on the 8-point scale were assigned values from -3.5 through

standard space in order to analyze volumetric differences between groups. for this study, only the gmv maps were used for statistical analyses. finally, the modulated grey-matter partitions were
